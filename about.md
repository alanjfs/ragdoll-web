Live life as a normally adjusted human being, or spend the next 7 years getting Ragdoll out the door. My choice.

Hi, my name is Marcus and I'm the author of Ragdoll. Why did I do this? (*At the start of my career back in 2008, I trained with some of the best animators in the world at Mindbender Animation Studio in Sweden. Only I didn't know that's what they were. Since then I've come to realise that animation is a hard problem.. blablabla*) We as an industry have come a long way in immersing an audience in our stories; we've solved accurate and expressive models through digital sculpting, we've solved visual effects like smoke and fire with voxels, we've solved photorealism with ray tracing techniques.. And yet we still animate like it's 1997!

Let me explain.

### Story v Life

Character animation can be thought of in two parts, story and life.

- Story is what message is being communicated, the purpose for a characer appearing on screen
- Life is the illusion that this character thinks for itself and is more than just an illustration

Story is all about key poses, or "keyframes". They are the most important aspect to both the animator and audience, but it is not the most difficult aspect. In fact, the animator spends less than 1/10th of their time on it.

Life is where things get hairy. Life is the quality in which story is told; it is what allows us to see through the technology and method with which a story is told, and focus on the message. The *what*, rather than the *how*.

Life is what most animaors get wrong, where most time is spent and why film today - no matter how photorealistic - still *feels* fake.
