# Ragdoll Dynamics

Real-time physics for AutodeskÂ® Maya 2020

<a class="button" href="download">Download v2020.10.12</a>

Intersections getting you down? Secondary animation causing you pain?

Look no further! Ragdoll enables animators to work directly with **live physics** in their character rigs, at real-time performance, by leveraging the same technology used by next-generation games.

- No more static cloth
- No more static hair
- No more static muscles
- No more intersections

The results can either plug straight into final render or give technical animators a physically realistic starting point for e.g. high-resolution folds in clothing, volumetric fascia simulation and skin sliding.

Animate with realistically simulated hair in real-time, for fine control over the final result. No more intersections, woho!

Real-time cloth for animators to stay on top of what cloth looks like in the final shot.

Simulate anatomically correct muscles for your animators, in real-time.

## Features

- **Performance** 0.1-5.0 ms/frame, from a single box to a full character with skeleton, hair, cloth and muscles running in parallel
- **Stability** Simulate anything from anatomically correct skeletons to complex mechanical contraptions
- **Collision Detection** Exactly what would would expect from any self-respecting physics solver
- **Constraints** Point, Orient and Parent constraints; just like regular Maya constraints, except physical!
- **Natural Forces** Push, Pull and Turbulence for perfect integration into any environment
- **Rewind and Continue** Play forwards and backwards without ever having to worry about returning to frame 1. Suck on that, nCloth!
- **Active Control** Balance animation and physics with life-like control over "virtual muscles"
- **Anatomical Limits** Precise control over the angle each limb or chain can attain
- **Determinsm** Trust that every playthrough is identical to the last, even on different machines and operating systems.
- **Python API** Precise integration into your pipeline with this first-class API, built with the fast and flexible [cmdx](https://github.com/mottosso/cmdx)
