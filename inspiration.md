### Inspiration

Some ideas of things to simulate.

### Stone Character

This one has some interesting interactions happening between the various rock pieces, something I think we could achieve with Ragdoll rather easily and efficiently, by just constraining pieces to the underlying limb, making the constraint weak and pulled towards the limb.

### Lying and Grabbing

A scene from Akira, where we can get some nice interactions between the girl and doll for free. Something which would be *very* difficult to get right without Ragdoll.

### Medusa

These snakes could get quite interesting if they were to be driven by guides, but still collide with the head and each other. There's an excellent reference in Clash of the Titans that could really use some realism.

### Realistic Hand

Integrating this into a picture or live footage could make for some quite appealing realistic-looking motion.

Here's one I made with WeightShift.

### Busy Train

Even without a realistic model, picture a dozen or so characters standing on this train, holding onto the railing, maybe reading a magazine, staring at their phone, at rush hour.

### Contraption II

This could make for an interesting experiment and test-of-strength for the solver. I expect Ragdoll should be able to solve this at 2-3 ms/frame whilst remaining very stable.

### Constraption III

Another interesting one, also showcases the strength and accuracy of the solver.
