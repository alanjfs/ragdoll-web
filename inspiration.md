### Inspiration

Some ideas of things to simulate.

### Stone Character

This one has some interesting interactions happening between the various rock pieces, something I think we could achieve with Ragdoll rather easily and efficiently, by just constraining pieces to the underlying limb, making the constraint weak and pulled towards the limb.

### Lying and Grabbing

A scene from Akira, where we can get some nice interactions between the girl and doll for free. Something which would be *very* difficult to get right without Ragdoll.

### Medusa

These snakes could get quite interesting if they were to be driven by guides, but still collide with the head and each other.

### Realistic Hand

Integrating this into a picture or live footage could make for some quite appealing realistic-looking motion.

### Busy Train

Without a realistic model, picture a dozen or so characters standing on this train, holding onto the railing, maybe reading a magazine. At rush hour, at close proximity (pre-covid).

### Contraption II

This could make for an interesting experiment and test-of-strength for the solver. I expect Ragdoll should be able to solve this at 2-3 ms/frame whilst remaining very stable.

### Constraption III

Another interesting one, also showcases the strength and accuracy of the solver.
